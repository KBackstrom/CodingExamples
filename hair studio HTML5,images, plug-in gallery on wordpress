<span style="color: #993300; font-size: 22px;"><strong>Welcome accomplished stylists: </strong></span>
<p style="padding-left: 70px;"><span style="color: #993300; font-size: 22px; padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Makayla Olmstead and Natalia Redman, to Marie Hair Studio</strong></span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #003300;">Makayla Olmstead</span></h3>
<a href="http://mariehairstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Makaylas-photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1041 alignleft" alt="Makaylas-photo" src="http://mariehairstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Makaylas-photo-148x300.jpg" width="148" height="300" /></a>
<p style="padding-left: 180px;">Makayla specializes in cutting fine hair. She enjoys styling short haircuts such as pixies, undercuts, and bobs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 180px;">Makayla is also skilled in the Ombre and Balayage techniques. Ombre color allows the hair to gradually fade from dark to light, or vice versa. Balayage creates soft, beachy highlights. Balayage looks very natural, and the roots are barely noticeable when the hair begins to grow out. Working with fantasy colors (pink, purple, blue, etc.) is also a color style that Makayla has fun with.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 300px;">Natalia offers hair masks made from fresh organic foods. Her hair masks are developed especially with the individual’s hair condition in mind. These organic hair masks nourish stressed and/or damaged hair, and help your hair return to a healthy status. Natalia promotes services that are organic and allergy free. Natalia is also very skilled at adding hair extensions that match your hair and appear very natural.</p>
