  <p><h2><center>WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE </center></h2></p>
  <p> I have been shoeing horses for over 20 years in SW Washington State.  It is my hope that this site will evolve
  over time and will offer you just that much more information in the area of horse hoof care maintenance. I will be adding additional tips now and then to help you with general horse care and hoof care. 
  Having a well cared for horse provides you with the option of gaining the best performance  from your horse. 
  Knowing what you should do, and when to do it, vastly improves the outcome of any situation. My goal is to add information to you in order to increase your horse maintenance skills.</p>
  
  <h2><center>How in the world did I become a horseshoer? </center></h2></p>
<p>It started with a mule. A big stubborn mule that did not want to be shod. 
When the horseshoer came to visit me and my mule Clyde we would begin the process by wrestling him. 
A lot of brusing and battering occurred of which the shoer and myself were the two receiving the brunt of it.  
The fiasco would continue until I sat on the mules neck holding him down while the shoer trimmed his feet. 
The horseshoer was so impressed with my abilties that he offered me an apprenticeship. 
After considering it I decided I would become a horseshoer. And that is how it all started. </p>

<h6>Bob prepares the horse prior to shoeing.</h6></p>
<p2>Bob ties the horse prior to shoeing.  Horses are claustrophobic by nature.  It is very important to know that your horse will tolerate being tied while the shoeing is taking place.  I prefer to hold my horse when the shoer is working.  This allows me to help the horse lean away from the farrier, rather than leaning on him/her. I am also able to keep the horses head away from the farrier. Horses can place a lot of pressure on the farriers back just by pushing their weight slightly to the side.  We also want to avoid the risk of the horse biting.</p2>

<h6>Taking off the horseshoe</h6></p>	
<p2>The Farrier will use pull-offs to loosen the shoe. The shoe will loosen enough so that it will come off.</p2>
<p><img src="images/Nipping-the-hoof-2.jpg" width="216" height="122" alt="trim" /><h6>Trimming the hoof using the nippers.</h6></p>	
<p2> After the shoe is removed the farrier will use nippers to trim off the excess hoof that has grown. To those of you who are new to horses, 
trimming does not hurt the horse.  Trimming the excess hoof is similar to clipping your human toenails or fingernails.  The farrier will use a hoof knife and rasp 
to take off dead skin from the frogge of the hoof. This is the soft triangular area of the horses foot. Just behind the frogge
is the buttress of the foot.  Loose and dead skin will also be trimmed from the buttress area so that the heal aligns closer toward the back of the frogge. This
action provides for just the right amount of heal. The sole is cleaned and pared out in the same manner. The sole should
have a white color mixed in with some darker areas.  There should not be any flakiness left on the sole at the end of this process.</p2>
&nbsp;
<p><img src="images/rasping_shaving-the-hoof.jpg" width="216" height="122" alt="rasping" /><h6>Using the rasp to shave and round off the hoof</h6></p>	
<p2>The farrier will use the rasp on the hoof wall so that it shapes the foot giving it a uniform roundness. The hoof wall should be a little higher
than the sole. This will allow for the horse to bear its weight on the hoof wall of the foot. Rounding the hoof wall properly will allow the horse to move correctly. That is, the left and right sides of the hoof will be
in balance with each other and the foot will maintain the appropriate angle. </p2>
<p><img src="images/trimmed-hooves.jpg" width="216" height="122" alt="trim close-up" />
<h6>Close-up of the back hooves after the trim</h6></p>
 <p2> An angle of 55 degrees is a good rule of thumb</p2>

<h6>This horse after the trim</h6></p>	
<p2> Unless you have had some lessons in trimming horses feet you should not try it out on your own.  Farriers do this everyday and make
the process look easy. Not knowing what you are doing can cause your horse to move poorly or worse yet cause lameness.  I am not saying
that you shouldn't trim your horse.  I am saying, and I am saying it LOUDLY, that if you want to trim your horse you need to get some training first. Some
veterinarian colleges and universities often offer course studies in hoof care that include trimming. </p2>
